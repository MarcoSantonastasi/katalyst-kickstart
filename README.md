# katalyst-kickstart 🚀

The templates in this repo are designed to kickstart your TDD practice

## What's in the templates?


- A "blank" project to get you up and running quickly 💨
- Test runner setup and example tests 👩🏽‍💻

### How to use the templates

1. Find the directory for your chosen language and set of tools <strong><sup>*</sup></strong>
1. Clone this repo and change into that directory <strong><sup>**</sup></strong>
1. Follow the instructions in the README for that directory

For example, to use the C# with NUnit scaffold:

```
git clone git@github.com:codurance/katalyst-kickstart.git
cd katalyst-kickstart 
cd csharp/nunit
cat README.md 
## or read in a browser - e.g. https://github.com/codurance/katalyst-kickstart/tree/main/csharp/nunit#readme
```

<strong><sup>*</sup></strong> If your chosen language and set of tools is not represented feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/codurance/katalyst-kickstart/issues) (or submit an existing one), or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/codurance/katalyst-kickstart/pulls) with a template of your own.

<strong><sup>**</sup></strong> If you don't want to download the whole repository you could do a [sparse checkout](https://github.community/t/how-can-i-download-a-specific-folder-from-a-github-repo/278/2)
